### About The Project

This repository is a collection of my practical works, exercises, and small projects created while learning web development.

Here you will find code written during my studies of various technologies, such as:
*   **HTML** & **CSS** (including Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
*   **JavaScript** (basics, DOM, ES6+, Async)
*   And potentially other frameworks and libraries as I progress.

### Goals
*   To organize and store my learning code.
*   To demonstrate learning progress.
*   To practice using Git and GitHub.
